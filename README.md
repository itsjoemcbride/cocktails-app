# Cocktails App

This application takes data from <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php">TheCocktailsDB</a>
API and presents it in a searchable, user-friendly react-based user interface.

On visiting the application, the database pulls search results from a user-entered searchphrase, and delivers a brief overview of each of the results. When a specific result is selected, a separate API call is made to lookup the ID of the selected item, and a recipe and some ingredients are retrieved.

This project was created to practice using `react`, `react-redux`, `redux-toolkit`, `axios` and `node-sass`.
